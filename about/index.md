## computers 🤝 acrokat
Growing up in a tiny town in Ohio, I was fascinated by the ways technology could not just connect me to people around the world, but allow me to form relationships and build a community.

Finding a place in the Tumblr (RIP) nerd community that allowed to bond with people who liked the same things as me, somehting that didn't exist in our small school. I knew I wanted to be a part of the empowerment technologyprovides.

I was very fortunate to have an awesome Computer Science education in high school, and to continue that at the University of Michigan. 

During my time at Michigan, I was fortunate to be able to continue my passions for writing and history in addition to my Computer Science curriculm whule also pursuing my love for music and community building through a deep involvement with a philanthropic org called MUSIC Matters. These experiences helped me  realize that though I deeply loved computers, I was obsessed with understanding the problems technology could solve. I discovered Product Managemnt and joined Microsoft for an internship which turned into a full time oppurtunity.

Since then, I have been loving growing as a PM and exploring all the ways to empower all different types of communities, from students to professional developers. 

And I'm still having a blast ✨
